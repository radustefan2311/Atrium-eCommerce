## Description

In this website users can select multiple products to view a detailed page containing information about that item, add them to cart. They can also login to access members only sales. I have built this website in order to learn more about the technologies used in it and to add it to my CV. I used mySQL as a database and Spring Boot as a framework for the backend language, JAVA. For the frontend I made use of Angular 14.

## Usage
### Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Run The Application

#### Run frontend
```
npm start
```

#### Run backend

You will need to manually run the Spring code in your IDE.
